# Toy Robot Simulator

## Description

This is a simple command line application described by
[specification.md](specification.md)

This coding challenge was origionally designed by Jon Eaves in 2007 while recruiting for ANZ. See

    https://joneaves.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/toy-robot-coding-test/

for a nice break down of its intent and limitations as a filtering tool for
recruitment purposes.

Ostensibly, it is a Object Oriented programing task with a clear focus on
testing, which is typical of its time. A more modern challenge might have
a stronger focus on user iterfaces, services, data, or even functional
programming, however, it still a prefectly adequate filtering tool.

A quick google search shows a number of attempts at this challenge in
a variety of languages. The first Python attempt I came across was:

    https://github.com/jessehon/robot-simulator

which seems to be a fairly adequate solution in Python 2.

I will attempt to do this Python 3 using more modern tooling.

## Plan

* Use pythion 3
* Use a virtual env and pip
* Test using pytest
